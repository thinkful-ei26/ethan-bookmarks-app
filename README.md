# ethan-bookmarks-app

As a user:

DONE I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
title
url link
description
rating (1-5)

DONE I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

DONE I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

DONE I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated above the chosen selection
