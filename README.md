# ethan-bookmarks-app

As a user:

DONE I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
title
url link
description
rating (1-5)

DONE I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
DONE All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

DONE I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
DONE Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

DONE I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

DONE I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

DONE I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated above the chosen selection


To do:
Implement condensed view on initial load and expanded view upon clicking an item
CONCERN: issues with handling bookmark object properties that aren't being passed to server?
Give yourself until 11 on the extension stories, then spend at least 3 hours cleaning up HTML and CSS

Clean up CSS and style buttons
CONCERN: i hate CSS
